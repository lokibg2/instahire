The main features of InstaHire are it enables easy searching of jobs and job seekers. The app provides map & location based searching. InstaHire employs a simple procedure. The job seekers register themselves and create a professional profile, showcasing their skills and their achievements. 

The profiles play an important role in ascertaining the skills of the employees. The employer simply searches for employees and gets a list of people, matching the requirement, along with the location. He/she can directly select and recruit people based on their profiles. There is also chat option which allows communication between the employer and employee. This can be used to simulate a quick interview process. 

On the other hand, if the requirement is small, the user can simply post about it on InstaHire and the interested employees would bid on the task. Thus InstaHire is capable of providing on-demand service for hiring (similar to modern cab services).

The bid amount as well as the location of the bidders is available on the map on the user's device. Based on the bid amount and the profile of the employee, the employer can award the project to the specific person and get it done soon. While, the work is in progress, the employer can keep track of the progress and can propose changes on the go, via the chat facility. Once the work is completed, the worker gets his payment via online transfer from the employer or can also be paid in person if convenient.

employees automatically. Moreover, the app uses a secure payment gateway and login portal and all details are securely stored to prevent any unauthorized access.
